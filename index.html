    <p>Family-owned and operated since 1985, Vicious Cycles has worked hard to become Central Carolina's source for motorcycles. We proudly represent Honda, Kawasaki, Can-Am, Harley Davidson, Star Motorcycles, and Yamaha. With over 25 years in the industry, we've learned a thing or two about bikes. Our sales team is composed of hard-core riders who venture out on the road regularly, they will happily escort you on a demo ride. Our service department is staffed with the best, most experienced crew of certified technicians anywhere and they are avid riders themselves. But if you like to do the work yourself, then Vicious Cycles has that covered, too. We maintain a generously stocked parts and accessories department manned by folks who also ride, a few even race. Come visit us today!</p>
